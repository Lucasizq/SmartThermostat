## Project Overview

 In order to create a smart thermostat,  we will require three main components. A stepper motor, a Pulse Signal Generator, and an arduino nano. The stepper motor will be used to rotate the thermostat left and right. The Pulse Signal Generatorwill be used to measure the range of the thermostat, allowing the user to calibrate it regardless of which thermostat they have. Lastly, the arduino nano will be used to control all aspects of software/hardware. An app will also be developed allowing for easy set-up and control.

## Educational Value Added

Hopefully, with the completion of this project, I will gain valuable skills that will be applicable in all areas of my field. The Arduino will require programming, building/design the project will require me to visit my old classes and re-apply what I had learned. Overall, I want to use this project as a way to refine my skills, while also gaining something valuable that I can add to my resume!
